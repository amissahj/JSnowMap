        <p id="wording" class="text">Improving access to family planning services and contraceptive uptake in low-middle-income countries are topical public health concerns. 
            Experts believe that access to modern contraceptives in LIMICs could reduce the problem of unmet needs, and avert over 54 million unwanted pregnancies and 26 million abortions worldwide each year [1,2]. 
            However,  the projection of achieving 65% global coverage is yet to be realized [1]. 
            Notwithstanding this, there is a huge gap to fill as family planning services uptake is progressively slow and Ghana is not an exception [3,4].  <br>
            Improvements in family planning services in Ghana over the years are yet to match up with the global population. The Ghana population policy targeted contraceptive prevalence to at least 50% by the year 2020 [5], 
            but this vision seems to be far from being real as the current contraceptive rate is still over around 26% among married women[6]. Experts believed that solving this unmet need could lead to important health dividends by of way averting the over 54% intended pregnancies and 23% abortions in Ghana [7,8].</b> </p>

        <h2>Facts About Ghana</h2>
        <p>
            The Republic of Ghana is centrally located in West Africa and shares a border with three French-speaking countries border it; in the east the Republic of Togo, in the north by Burkina Faso, and in the west by La Côte d’Ivoire. The Gulf of Guinea lies to the south and stretches across 560 kilometers of the country’s coastline. 
            <br><br>The country has a total population of 30,792,608 occupying a land area of 238,533 square kilometers, with sixteen (16) administrative regions and 260 decentralized districts to ensure equitable resource allocation and efficient, effective administration at the local level. 
            <br><br>The country’s population is dominantly female (50.7%) against males (49.3%)(Ghana Statistical Service, 2021). With a literacy rate of 69.8% and a labour force of 58.1% respectively, Ghana's GDP was $73.77 billion with a per capita of $2031.43 at the end of 2022(Economics, 2022; Ghana Statistical Service, 2021).
            <br><br>The population of Ghana is a relatively younger one, as is dominated by young people aged  15-35 (38.2%) and nearly, 6-in-10 persons are aged between 18-65 years (see figure 1 in the appendix) (Ghana Statistical Service, 2021).
